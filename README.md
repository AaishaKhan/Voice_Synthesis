## 🎙️ Introduction🎙️
The Speech Synthesis Project is a Python application that demonstrates various speech synthesis functionalities, including speech-to-text, translation, and text-to-speech. This project uses popular libraries like `speech_recognition`, `googletrans`, and `gtts` to perform these tasks.

- Python 3.x
- speech_recognition
- googletrans==3.1.0a0
- gTTS

## 🚀 Getting Started 
![istockphoto-184941527-612x612](https://github.com/AaishaKhan/Voice_Synthesis/assets/65846423/3621feb7-d287-45c5-a2e5-21d9c8c61c54)


To run the project, you need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can install the required libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install googletrans==3.1.0a0
pip install gTTS

 ### 📁 Project Structure <h1/>

- `speech_synthesis.py`: This is the main Python script that contains the code for speech synthesis tasks.
- `english_audio_file.wav`: Sample English audio file for speech-to-text demonstration.

###  💻 How to Use

1. Replace `english_audio_file.wav` with your own English audio file for speech-to-text.
2. Run the script `speech_synthesis.py`.

###  📝 Explanation

The `speech_synthesis.py` script performs the following tasks:

1. **Speech-to-Text (English)**: Using the `speech_recognition` library, it converts speech in an audio file to English text. 🗣️

2. **Translation to Hindi**: It translates the recognized English text to Hindi using the `googletrans` library. 🌐

3. **Text-to-Speech (Hindi)**: Using the `gTTS` library, it generates speech in Hindi from the translated text and saves it as an audio file. 🔊
